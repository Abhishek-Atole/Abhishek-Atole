# ✅ GitHub Portfolio Upgrade Checklist

**Goal:** Create a portfolio that clearly communicates your strength as a C++ / System / Backend Engineer and makes hiring managers want to reach out.

---

## 🧠 1. PROFILE LEVEL (FIRST IMPRESSION)

### 🔲 Create a Professional GitHub Profile README  
- [ ] Write a concise summary: who you are and what roles you're targeting (C++, System Engineer, Backend).
- [ ] Highlight your top technical skills: C++, Linux, CGAL, Data Structures, OS Concepts, etc.
- [ ] Showcase your best work with links and brief descriptions.
- [ ] Add stats badges: GitHub stats, languages used, etc.
- [ ] Link to resume, portfolio website (if any), and LinkedIn.

---

## 📌 2. PINNED REPOSITORIES

### 🔲 Curate 4–6 high-impact repos:
- [x] Polygon Boolean Visualizer
- [x] Virtual File System
- [x] Generalized DS Library
- [x] EMG Classification (optional, not a primary match)
- [ ] Add a new system/back-end project (see suggestions below)

---

## 📁 3. INDIVIDUAL REPOSITORIES — STANDARD UPGRADE TASKS

For *each repository* (especially the 4 reviewed ones):

### 🔲 README.md
- [ ] Overview of the project
- [ ] Features & goals
- [ ] Technologies used (C++, Qt, CGAL, etc.)
- [ ] Demo video / GIF / screenshots
- [ ] Build instructions (preferably with CMake)
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Folder structure (optional)
- [ ] Credits / licenses if applicable
- [ ] Badges: Language, Stars, Last Updated, etc.

### 🔲 Code Structure & Build System
- [ ] Use `src/`, `include/`, and `tests/` folders for modular structure
- [ ] Add `CMakeLists.txt` for C++ projects
- [ ] Add a Makefile for C projects

### 🔲 Testing
- [ ] Add test cases using **Google Test** (C++) or test scripts (C/Python)
- [ ] Create a `tests/` directory
- [ ] Include example test results in README

### 🔲 Version Control Hygiene
- [ ] Use **clear, consistent commit messages** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
- [ ] Organize branches for feature dev (if applicable)

### 🔲 Documentation
- [ ] Add **Doxygen** comments for functions/classes in C++ repos
- [ ] Generate `docs/` folder using Doxygen or markdown
- [ ] Create `USAGE.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md` for complex repos (e.g., VFS)

### 🔲 CI/CD & Automation
- [ ] Add a **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - [ ] Build & test on push/pull
  - [ ] Run `clang-format` or `cppcheck` for code linting
- [ ] Add status badges to README (`build passing`, `tested`, etc.)

### 🔲 Visuals
- [ ] Include diagrams:
  - UML Class Diagrams (for DS or FS)
  - Architecture flowcharts
  - CLI screenshots (for VFS)
- [ ] Embed short **demo videos** for GUI/ML projects

---

## 🚀 4. NEW PROJECT SUGGESTIONS (OPTIONAL BUT IMPACTFUL)

Add one or more of the following to **fill system/backend gaps**:

### 🔲 ⬜ Multithreaded C++ HTTP Server  
### 🔲 ⬜ Custom Memory Allocator (`malloc()` clone)  
### 🔲 ⬜ C++ Key-Value Store (with B-trees or Hash Tables)  
### 🔲 ⬜ REST API using C++ frameworks (Crow, Pistache, RestBed)  
### 🔲 ⬜ Dockerize an existing project + add deployment docs  

---

## 📊 5. LONG-TERM PROFESSIONAL UPGRADES

### 🔲 Add contribution graphs/stats using GitHub API  
### 🔲 Open-source contributions  
### 🔲 Link to GSoC application or blog (if public)  

---

## 🔁 Maintenance & Activity

### 🔲 Weekly GitHub hygiene (set 30 min/week):
- [ ] Refactor old code
- [ ] Respond to issues (if any)
- [ ] Add improvements or new test cases
- [ ] Keep README and demo links fresh
